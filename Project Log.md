# Project Log
Notes on what I did each day so that I can keep track of my changes and remember where/what I was working on

**01/22/2024**
- Installed Mu and plugged in TinyS3 Pro
  - Defualt code running
- Downloaded latest ui_hooks.py and installed into OLD PathPilot VM
- Commented out lines in ~/tmc/python/pathpilotmanager.py so that I don't have to pick configuration of machine every time
```
# state of the VM leftover from a previous student.
#            if os.path.exists(PATHPILOTJSON_FILE):
#                os.unlink(PATHPILOTJSON_FILE)
#                print "Removing config file to force selection of machine type in sim mode."
```
- Installed ToolPrint_plugin.py on OLD Pathpilot VM and verified it is working
